club-app monorepo.

initalized as an NPM directory because NPM makes things easy!

## Dev

Note: Can run each individually. No need to run all if not required

### Presequites
- Docker (docker-compose)
- npm i in all subdirectories (club-app-be ws and worker)
- npm run dev

to run, `npm run dev`. first run will take a minute so grab a drink :)

## Todo

Everything, but currently:
- Migrate to Schema as code in `club-app-hasura`
- Finish UI
- Event subscriptions
- Persist Data
