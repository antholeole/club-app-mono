# Tools
## [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
Obsidian is the easiest way to make a git-committed internal wiki. It allows for viewing markdown files with ease and seeing the relationships between them.

## [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
Postman allows us to mock API calls and become a headless version of our frontend. This allows for quick manual testing and edge case testing of backend API's.

While the collection is checked into the monorepo, it is not automatically synced like Obsidian - you will need to [manually export the collection.](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#exporting-postman-data)

## [VsCode Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### [Bloc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FelixAngelov.bloc)
Easy use of Flutter Bloc.

### [Bracket Pairs]( https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)
Flutter goes hard with nested brackets. Use this if you don't want to lose your mind!

### [Restore Terminals](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EthanSK.restore-terminals)
When opening the project in vsCode, will automatically open 3 terminals:
1. That runs the backend
2. That runs the Flutter App
3. Misc (for other stuff)


### Others
Obviously, you will need the editor extensions for:
- Dart
- Flutter
- Typescript
